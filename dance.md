Dancing is an activity I love dearly.
It's one of my favorite activities because its challenging and it allows me
to express my myself freely.
I love improvisation. That is why I fell in love with Jazz and thats why
I am so in love with (social) dancing.
I've thought a lot about what connection means and why my
dance philosophy is.
I will share that soon.
