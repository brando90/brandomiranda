Dancing is an activity I love dearly.
It's one of my favorite activities because its challenging and it allows me
to express my myself freely.
I love improvisation. That is why I fell in love with Jazz and thats why
I am so in love with (social) dancing.
I've thought a lot about what connection means and why my
dance philosophy is.
I will share that soon.


# How to improvise in Dance and Jazz

- I originally wrote [this](https://qr.ae/TUK1i7) this answer on Quora  with respect to
Jazz improvisation but a lot of it holds for Dancing too. I will be updating this
for dancing some day!

# UIUC Bachata Sensual and Zouk

I am the founder and president of UIUC Bachata Sensual & Zouk, student
group interested in promoting the latin dances Bachata & Brazilean Zouk.

- Click [here](https://illinois.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/facebookuiucsbachata) for the university website.

- Our mission is also to promote and spread dancing as far as possible.
With that in mind we try to record all our videos of the moves we teach
with counts and explanations.
We post them in [our youtube page]().
