# About me #

I am a scientist and engineering, interested moving the powerful and beautiful field of A.I. closer to true Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
I believe an important direction is understanding how to combine cognitive and neuro-inspired models, specially investigating how reasoning and learning work together.
I also believe being able to adapt to new tasks using prior experience and using previous knowledge is crucial for AGI to occur. Therefore, right now I am a 2nd-year Ph.D. student working on meta-learning and machine learning (ML) for
Theorem Proving (TP).

This is my temporary page and will be updated to something better soon!
Stay tuned for it and my blog too! ;)
