# About me #

I am a scientist and an engineer that is interested in moving forward the powerful
and beautiful field of A.I. closer to true Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
I believe an important direction is understanding how to combine cognitive and neuro-inspired models, specially investigating how reasoning and learning work together.
In addition, I also believe being able to adapt to new tasks using prior experience and knowledge is crucial for AGI to occur.
Consequently, I decided to pursue a PhD where I am a 2nd-year Ph.D. student working on meta-learning and machine learning (ML) for
Theorem Proving (TP) at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).

This is my temporary page and will be updated to something cooler soon.
Stay tuned for it and check out my blog too! ;)
