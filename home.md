# Bio #

Brando Miranda is a current Ph.D. Student at [Stanford University](https://stanford.edu) under the supervision of [Professor Sanmi Koyejo](https://cs.stanford.edu/~sanmi/index.html)
in the department of Computer Science.
Previously he has been a graduate student at [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), Research Assistant at MIT's 
[Center for Brain Minds and Machines (CBMM)](https://cbmm.mit.edu/), and a graduate student at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://mit.edu/).
Miranda's research interests lie in data-centric machine learning for foundation models, 
meta-learning, machine learning for theorem proving, and human & brain-inspired Artificial Intelligence (AI). 
Miranda completed his Master of Engineering in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science under the supervision of 
[Professor Tomaso Poggio](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/profile/tomaso-poggio/) -- where he did research on Deep Learning Theory.
Miranda has been the recipient of several awards, 
including Most Cited Paper Certificate awarded by International Journal of Automation & Computing (IJAC),
two Honorable Mention with the Ford Foundation Fellowship,
Computer Science Excellence Saburo Muroga Endowed Fellow, 
Stanford School of Engineering fellowship, and is currently an EDGE Scholar at Stanford University.

[//]: # (Our Culture:
[//]: # (  
[//]: # (Our lab has a high technical bar, including a coding interview for all applicants. We constantly push each other to improve through continuous, regular feedback. We take mentorship seriously and are committed to students' success beyond their time in our lab. As a member of our lab, you will be working alongside prior USACO and IMO participants. We have exceedingly high expectations of all collaborators and do not tolerate mediocrity. look for his lab page Sebastian Thrun's lab.)
