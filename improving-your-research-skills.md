title: Improving your Research Skills
---

This semester (fall 2019) I am taking CS598 Improving Your Research Skills.
I think this class is very important for researchers but also for people
interested in working in high uncertainty environments (e.g. start ups).
I hope my blogging helps people and myself create a more productive world in
innovation.
I hope it also sparks interesting discussion where we all learn.
