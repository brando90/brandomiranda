In this webpage I am hoping to share my miscellaneous projects I've worked on.
I'm still working on this page!

# Machine Learning related

- When I took [9.520 at MIT fall 2014](http://www.mit.edu/~9.520/fall14/) with the wonderful professors
[Lorenzo Rosasco](http://web.mit.edu/lrosasco/www/) and
[Tomaso Poggio](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/profile/tomaso-poggio/),
I made a survey of my own explanation of the concepts and
mathematical proofs of
[Uniforms Stability and Generalization in Statistical Learning Theory](_posts/2019-10-31-uniform-stability.md).
Enjoy!

  - By the way, the wonderful Center for Brain Minds and Machines (CBMM), that I was part
of, has the commitment to have global impact and with that have made multiple of
their courses available online, [including 9.520/6.860](https://cbmm.mit.edu/lh-9-520/lecture-videos). Check them out!
