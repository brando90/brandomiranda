- When I took 9.520 at MIT with the wonderful professors
[Lorenzo Rosasco](http://web.mit.edu/lrosasco/www/) and
[Tomaso Poggio](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/profile/tomaso-poggio/),
I made a survey of my own explanation of the concepts and
mathematical proofs of [Uniforms Stability and Generalization in (statistical)
Learning Theory](https://qr.ae/TWo7oy). Enjoy!
