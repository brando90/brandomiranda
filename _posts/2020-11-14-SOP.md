# SOP Writing for Graduate School with Jaime Potter and LCS

I've been working this past year as the graduate advisor for 
[LCS (Latinxs in Computer Science)](http://latinoscs.web.illinois.edu/) at [UIUC](https://illinois.edu/).
The main project I've been leading with LCS the 
Professional development & wellness colloquium.
It is aimed at improving students' general career and personal life.
I believe that career development and well-being are 
strongly interrelated, especially after my lower back injury from 2018 that challenges me every day.

We had the honor to have as a speaker Organizational Behavioural expert from
Wharton School of Business [Jaime Potter](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaimepotter/?sh=23f72a294e31).
He now works as a Business Development Manager & Recruiter for Core Staffing, a 30+ year old HR staffing firm in NYC.


Hope you learn a lot from the talk, just as much as we did!

I will include the original description for the talk we had when we advertized the talk.
