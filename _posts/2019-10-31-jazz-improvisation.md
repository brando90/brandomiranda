I originally wrote [this](https://qr.ae/TUK1i7) answer on Quora on
Jazz improvisation.
Jazz and improvisation are two activities close to my heart.
Right now I engage a lot more on dance improvisation but I believe the
two are very similar.
I will be expanding on the dancing one some day.

I owe this to the many American Jazz musicians that have influenced my life
like Larry Russell, George Michael and the local blues musician Brooks in McAllen Texas.
