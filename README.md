# My notes on making a website

# Initializing a jekyll project

To start/create a brand new webpage with jekyll do the following:
```
jekyll new brandos-awesome-statitic-site
```
it will dump all the jekyll stuff in that new folder. If you messed up and already have a folder like that you can do:
```
jekyll --force new brandos-awesome-statitic-site
```
this will overwrite things. Careful!
