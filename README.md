# My notes on making a static website

# Initializing a jekyll project

To start/create a brand new webpage with jekyll do the following:
```
jekyll new brandos-awesome-statitic-site
```
it will dump all the jekyll stuff in that new folder. If you messed up and already have a folder like that you can do:
```
jekyll --force new brandos-awesome-statitic-site
```
this will overwrite things. Careful!

# Run localhost version of the static site:

Run a localhost version of the website:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Then on the terminal there is a url for the local serving of your static site:

```
Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/
```
put that in the browser search bar.

# Gemfile #

To understand a Gemfile we need to understand what is a Gem.

## Gem ##

A Gem is a downloadable package of Ruby code or a budle of code we can include in Ruby projects.  This allows us to take someone else's code and drop it into our own project. Jekyll itself is a Gem as well as many Jekyll plugins.

## Gemfile ##

A Gemfile is Rubyâ€™s dependency management system or in other words, a list of Gems a Ruby project needs to run.

# Themes

Recall that a Gem is a downloadable package of Ruby code. Themes can be packaged as Gems.

# Adding a main page that isn't the "here are my blogs list"

# Adding a post

To create a blog post you can create it manually in the `_posts` folder. e.g. by creating a `.md` file with the usual stuff above (TODO check name of this, front page or something?):

```
