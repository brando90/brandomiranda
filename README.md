# My notes on making a static website

# Initializing a jekyll project

To start/create a brand new webpage (in your current directory) with jekyll do the following:

```
jekyll new brandos-awesome-statitic-site
```

it will create a folder for your site in `brandos-awesome-statitic-site` and dump all the jekyll stuff needed in it. If you messed up and already have a folder like that you can do:

```
jekyll --force new brandos-awesome-statitic-site
```

this will overwrite things. Careful!

# Run localhost version of the static site:

Run a localhost version of the website:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Then on the terminal there is a url for the local serving of your static site:

```
Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/
```
put that in the browser search bar.

# Gemfile #

To understand a Gemfile we need to understand what is a Gem.

## Gem ##

A Gem is a downloadable package of Ruby code or a budle of code we can include in Ruby projects.  This allows us to take someone else's code and drop it into our own project. Jekyll itself is a Gem as well as many Jekyll plugins.

## Gemfile ##

A Gemfile is Rubyâ€™s dependency management system or in other words, a list of Gems a Ruby project needs to run. I think of it as Ruby's pip but in a file. To install the gems for the current project do:

```
bundle
```

where the gemfile is located at. This will install the new gems (if there are new). You can check the newly installed gems with:

```
gem list
```

# Themes #

## Themse with Gems ##

Recall that a Gem is a downloadable package of Ruby code. Themes can be packaged as Gems.

Lets install the Athena theme as an example. Add to your `Gemfile` the following (perhaps close to where all the themses you've installed are at):

```
gem "jekyll-athena"
```

then run:

```
bundle
```

to install the gem. Now you can use the gem! Just tell the `_config.yml` so that the server knows which one to run. For example, change the theme field as follows for our Athena example:

```
theme: "jekyll-athena"
```

Now you can use any theme you've installed by changing the `_config.yml` file!

# Adding a post

To create a blog post you can create it manually in the `_posts` folder. e.g. by creating a `.md` file with the usual stuff above (TODO check name of this, front page or something?):

```
