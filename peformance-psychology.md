# Performance psychology

I'm very interested in being the best version of myself in the most essential aspects of my life.
Thus, over the years I've spent a lot of times reading about 
[performance psychology](https://larrygmaguire.com/what-is-performance-psychology/#:~:text=Performance%20psychology%20is%20a%20subdivision,factors%20influencing%20optimal%20human%20performance.&text=Through%20assisting%20professionals%20to%20refine,improving%20and%20enhancing%20human%20performance.)
and (seemingly unrelated) areas that make me better (in my professionally and personal life).

The most influential things I've pursued in this area are the following:

1. During my journey to learn how to cope with stress I was forunate enough to have
found a wonderful therapeutic programs for anxiety developed by the neuroscientist 
and addiction psychitrist [Dr Judson Brewer](https://drjud.com/).
This is the link to his program: [Unwinding Anxiety](https://www.unwindinganxiety.com/).
I was lucky to find this during my time at MIT's CBMM since he is an adjoint professor
at MIT's Brain and Cognitive Science ([BCS](https://bcs.mit.edu/)) department. 

2. I've been strongly influenced by Professor [Cal Newport's](https://www.calnewport.com/) 
philosophy of living a deep focused life.
I've read most of [his books](https://www.calnewport.com/books/) and
taken [his courses](https://www.scotthyoung.com/courses/) 
with [Scott Young](https://www.scotthyoung.com/).
I am, of course, an avid listener of [his podact](https://www.calnewport.com/podcast/). 

3. I also love [Dr. Andrew Huberman's podcast](https://hubermanlab.com/) on science
(and neuroscience!) based protocols for health, wellness, and performance.
