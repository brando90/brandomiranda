Self-improvement is one of my favorite hobbies (in addition to dancing).
I love reading lots of books on self-improvement, productivity, psychology,
relationships, love, mindfulness and more!
I've also been involved in many activities that I believe have helped me grow
like life coaching, therapy, leadership training, and more!
I can't help it, I am obsessed (in a good way!) to being the best in every
dimension in my life that I value and have time to improve.

1) This one is one that I learn in my search
to having better relationships with the people I love and value in my life:

2) In the search to become less stressed and less anxious I found one of the most
wonderful and powerful therapeutic programs for anxiety.
It was developed by the neuroscientist and addiction psychitrist Dr. Brewer.
His course is called [Unwinding Anxiety](https://www.unwindinganxiety.com/).
I highly recommend it if you want to improve your life by 100 fold.
