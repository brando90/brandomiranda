# Prospective Collaborations: Interested in a collaborating with me on a research project?

This is a great read for all: 
[Professor Koyejo's advise for his own prospective students](https://cs.stanford.edu/~sanmi/preparation.html).

## Undergraduates and Master Students at Stanford

I'm always keen and excited to work with motivated and talented students. 
I also always have more ideas than I can ever execute. 
However, research is challenging -- yet rewarding -- and mentoring is a time-consuming endeavor. 
Therefore, I've created this process to aid me in the selection of prospective mentees:

The application process to work with me is designed to ensure dedicated, independent, and focused individuals are selected for mentoring opportunities. 
In order to be considered, please adhere to the following steps -- where step 1-4 should be included in your email to me:

1. Submit a small paragraph detailing your motivation for engaging in research and career plans. Along stating if you can commit to a minimum of 10 hours per week. I typically recommend a 20-hour weekly commitment, as research can be challenging, and it is crucial that the time I invest in mentoring is used effectively. A commitment of at least two quarters is required, with a recommended duration of three to four quarters.
2. Provide a copy of your CV and all relevant academic transcripts. It is your responsibility to clarify any unfamiliar information or discrepancies that may be present in your documents. Completion of classes related to machine learning, such as CS 229 or Deep Learning CS 230, is a minimum requirement, as well as coding and software development experience.
3. I would also like to learn about your proficiencies in the areas of mathematics, science, and engineering.
4. Take part in a technical interview, during which you will spend approximately 10 minutes discussing your contributions to a previous technical project you have been involved in + 5 minutes discussing the project.
5. Obtain a strong recommendation letter -- ideally from a faculty member. While a brief letter will suffice, a more comprehensive endorsement is preferred. If they are a faculty and do not have the time to write a letter -- an e-mail endorsing you would suffice. 


By following these steps, you will demonstrate your commitment to excellence and your ability to work independently. 
To foster a productive and professional working relationship I'd like to outline my minimum expectations:

1. Independence, Initiative and Communication: I expect you to work independently while maintaining consistent communication. Ideally, we should stay in touch daily or weekly through asynchronous means, rather than relying on lengthy, unproductive meetings. I strongly prefer not to use Zoom for meetings. In-person meetings are preferred and I expect those encounters to be efficient and valuable for both of us.
2. Recommended Reading: I encourage prospective mentees and collaborators to review the following resource, which I plan to include on my webpage: [Professor Koyejo's advise for his own prospective students](https://cs.stanford.edu/~sanmi/preparation.html). This material provides valuable insights and guidance for working together effectively.
3. Intrinsic motivation and curiosity are essential for successful research, as they encourage individuals to pose insightful questions, investigate novel perspectives, and make meaningful contributions, collectively resulting in substantial advancements and breakthroughs in the field. Moreover, genuine interest serves as a driving force to persevere through challenging moments in research and cultivate enduring motivation.
4. My Mentoring Style: Tackling complex challenges necessitates empowering mentees to work independently and resourcefully. Consequently, I expect you to operate autonomously and optimize the use of available resources. Meetings will typically be held once every one to two weeks, with a focus on efficient asynchronous communication. It is crucial that you capitalize on the wealth of resources at Stanford. To illustrate the importance of independence, my intervention in debugging your code will be limited and sparing. I do recommend to use GPT-4 and always verify it's output rigorously. 

By adhering to these expectations, we can establish a productive and professional mentoring relationship, marked by independence, initiative, and open communication.The pursuit of discovery and the opportunity to contribute knowledge to our field is a profoundly beautiful and rewarding experience. While professionalism is crucial, it is equally important to embrace a grander vision, one that transcends our individual efforts and aspires to make a lasting impact on the world. Together, we can channel our passion and expertise to inspire meaningful change and shape the future. I believe this is one of the roles of scientific research.

If you are interested, I look forward to reviewing your application (e-mail me at brando9 aT stanford dOT edu and which project you are interested in and why) and potentially embarking on a fruitful mentoring relationship.

## Project Ideas

Here are some potential projects I'm interested in: [project list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HBBmEKb2JJrhWab5Chnadpru_z_ZHF-1i28tKIXlq-U/edit?usp=sharing).
If you have your own or an adaptation of my that aligns with my interests, I'm happy to discuss it with you -- but
will expect that you have scoped it in a persuasive matter, thought about the impact, and have a clear plan for how you will execute it.

## Postdocs, Junior student, fellow Graduates students, and the rest

Shoot me an e-mail (brando AT stanford DOt edu) and we can discuss potential collaborations.

<!-- 4. Participate in a technical interview, which will consist of a 15-minute discussion about a question related to your project, followed by a 15-minute coding interview based on the style of "Cracking the Coding Interview." Alternatively, you may opt for a week or two week long interview mini-project related to your research project. Including describing your past technical projects and technical contributions. -->
