If you are a interested in working with me as your mentor send me your CV/resume and transcript to my UIUC e-mail 
and how our research interests align. 
Make sure your CV outlines the projects you've work on.
If you have someone who you've worked with and can speak to your work ethic, consistency, indepedence, collaborative spirit or other qualities that would make you
a good research mentee, request for them a short reference.
This has more importance to me than your transcript.
